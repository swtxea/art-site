      <p>Larry Wolf's work reflects his unique ability to combine his passion for law with his love for artistic expression through bold texture and vibrant colors.  Dedicating almost 30 years of his life to building his legal skills, Wolf explores his experiences in this field through introspection that is expressed in his series of original paintings entitled, "A Brush with the Law.  Each piece communicates Wolf's struggle to search for new alternatives and solutions to problems both in art and in the courtroom.  This series expresses his drive to look at things in a new way. It was only two years ago that Wolf began to communicate this passion by creating original work.  Art has become an outlet that has taken him on a journey that he shares with us through these works that are as intriguing to the mind as they are a delight to the eye.</p>
